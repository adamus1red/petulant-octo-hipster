    <p>The Strathclyde Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (StrathSEDS) is an engineering/science-based society for undergraduate and postgraduate students of the University of Strathclyde.

    <p>The society aims to be working on at least one relatively large space engineering project throughout each academic year along while running other, smaller projects for members to get involved in. Formed in 2011, StrathSEDS has since developed the foundations for Scotland’s first university satellite programme (StrathSat-R) which was successfully launched on a sounding rocket by the European Space Agency. We are also in the process of designing, building and testing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT).

    <p>StrathSEDS works collaboratively with the university’s research centres such as the Advanced Space Concepts Laboratory, and offers great opportunities for academic projects to be carried out within StrathSEDS.
